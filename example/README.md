## Simulated Annealing For Dart - Example
[![Dart](https://github.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

The examples presented here demonstrate how to:
- define a [search space],
- specify an [annealing schedule],
- define an energy field and logging [simulator].

The [simulator] is used to find the global minimum of a continuous
3D function defined for a spherical region with radius 2.0 centred
around the origin.
