## Simulated Annealing For Dart - Example
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing)

The examples presented here demonstrate how to define a:
- [search space],
- [annealing schedule],
- system energy and logging [simulator].

The [simulator] is used to find the global minimum of a continuous
3D function defined for a spherical region with radius 2.0 centred
around the origin.
