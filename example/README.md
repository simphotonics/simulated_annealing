## Simulated Annealing For Dart - Example
[![Dart](https://github.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simphotonics/simulated_annealing/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

The examples presented [here][example] demonstrate how to:
- define a [search space][search space],
- specify an [annealing schedule][annealing schedule],
- define an energy field and logging [simulator][simulator].

The [simulator][simulator] is used to find the global minimum of a continuous
3D function defined for a spherical region with radius 2.0 centered
around the origin.
